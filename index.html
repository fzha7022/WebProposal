			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>The LGBTIQ+ community has been slowly but steadily been recognized and provided rights by legal institutions within
				Australia since the 1970s. The LGTIQ+ community is a minority population group that covers a spectrum of genders, sexualities
				and relationships. How they identify themselves depends upon a plethora of socioeconomic and demographic factors. By
				2016, about 3 percent of the adult population identified as being homosexual or bisexual. A little over 2 percent reported
				themselves as belonging to other sexual orientations or not being sure.</p>

      <h3 id="topic">The Topic</h3>
      <p>The topic of this charity website proposal is LGBTQ. This website aims to create a friendly community for intersex, trans and gender diverse people that can support them, be devoted to their right, and it is also a channel to collect donation for the charity.</p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
      <p><strong>What is LGBTQ facing now:</strong>
      <ul>
		  <li>Australians of diverse sexual orientation, sex or gender identity may account for up to 11% of the Australian population. Same-sex couples make up about 1% of all couples in Australia. In 2011, there were around 33,700 same-sex couples in Australia, including 17,600 male same-sex couples and 16,100 female same-sex couples. The number of same-sex couples more than tripled between 1996 and 2011.</li>
		  <li>In 2011, there were 6,300 children living in same-sex couple families, up from 3,400 in 2001. Most of these children (89 per cent) are in female same-sex couple families.</li>
		  <li>A large number of LGBTI people hide their sexuality or gender identity when accessing services (34 per cent), at social and community events (42 per cent) and at work (39 per cent).</li>
		  <li>LGBTI young people report experiencing verbal homophobic abuse (61 per cent), physical homophobic abuse (18 per cent) and other types of homophobia (nine per cent), including cyberbullying, graffiti, social exclusion and humiliation.</li>
	 	  <li>Transgender males and females experience significantly higher rates of non-physical and physical abuse compared with lesbians and gay men. Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people are three times more likely to experience depression compared to the broader population.</li>
      <li>71% of LGBTI+ people aged 16 to 27 indicated that they did not use a crisis support service during their most recent personal or mental health crisis. 32.6% of LGBTI+ people aged 16 to 27 who had not used a crisis support service during their most recent personal or mental health crisis indicated that their decision was due to anticipated discrimination.</li>
      <li>29% of LGBTI+ people aged 16 to 27 who had not used a crisis support service during their most recent personal or mental health crisis indicated that their decision was due to not thinking that their experience warranted crisis intervention.</li>
      <li>28.8% of LGBTI+ people aged 16 to 27 who had not used a crisis support service during their most recent personal or mental health crisis indicated that their decision was due to being unaware of crisis support services or unaware of LGBTI+ specialist services.</li>
	    </ul></p>
			<p><strong>A Gender Agenda</strong> aims to support the goals and needs of the intersex, transgender and gender diverse communities of Canberra and the surrounding region. Through education, advocacy, peer support and professional networks they connect people to each other and build off the wisdom of collective experiences. For over ten years, AGA has represented a gold standard of TGD+I support that is unique in Australia.</p>
      <blockquote>
				AGA adopts a collaborative approach in all aspects of our work. We work from a strengths-based model and seek to find and build on points of commonality with other sectors and service providers. We pride ourselves on continually resourcing our service with up to date information and knowledge to ensure we are providing the best possible supports to our community. It is also important for us to be articulating understandings of sex and gender identity in ways that ensure there is an awareness that these issues are fundamental issues that affect all of us.

			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>The user of this website can be divided into three main groups: homosexual, transgender and others. The homosexual group and the transgender group are representing the people who are seeking help and a sense of belonging, or just want to meet other LGBTQ and help someone like them. The others group represents the people who are not a homosexual or transgender and are only interested in appealing to the equal right for LGBTQ and helping them.</p>

			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>When I was designing my website, I have tried to avoid too much information on one screen and make sure the rainbow element wasn't being dominant. I have considered the balance of text and pictures so that the users won't feel boring as they were scrolling. The extensive use of the photo of the members and the events has a great attraction to the LGBTQ group.</p>
